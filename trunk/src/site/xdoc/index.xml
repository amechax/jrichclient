			<p>JRichClient is a set of Java developer libraries to build rich 
			Swing desktop client applications.  The first library is RichDock, a 
			docking framework to manage the windows within your application.</p>
			
			<subsection name="Work in Progress">
				<p>This is a work in progress.  Check back for announcements as
				the project develops.</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Main Modules">
				<ul>
					<li>RichDock is the main module for the Java docking framework.</li>
					<li>RichDock Demo is a module of demonstration applications.</li>
				</ul>
			</subsection>
			
			<subsection name="Other Modules">
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2006/03/23/multi-split-pane.html">
					MultiSplitPane</a> is based on code written by Hans Muller
					of Sun Microsystems. The MultiSplitDockingPort 
					implementation uses this code. This code is included as part 
					of <a href="https://swingx.dev.java.net/">SwingX</a>, but 
					rather than depend on the entire library, we break out only 
					the code needed by JRichClient into its own separate module.</li>
